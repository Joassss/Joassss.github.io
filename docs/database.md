# Database

> Last edited: 1/23/2022 at 12:58PM

QuaBot uses a database to store data about servers, in this article we will explain what we store and what happens if the database gets reset.

### What is it used for?
We use a database to store settings, among other things. We store the guild id, to find it later, and the channels, roles, enabled modules, join messages and other things you've changed in your config. We also store level data, and reaction roles, warn id's, suggestion and report id's, polls.

### What to do when it resets?
First: Fix your /config, any setting in there has been set to the default.
Then fix any reactionroles you have setup. Sadly you will have lost level data, and can't recall warnings, close suggestions and more. You can contact our developers in our [support discord](https://discord.quabot.net) to restore any important things you've lost.
